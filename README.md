# Sharelodge - File sharing made easy and Fast

## Motivation :
The internet has made it extremely easy for anyone and everyone to share files. Whether you work for a company, work as a freelancer, or just want to share funny dog videos with friends, family, or business associates, file sharing is something everyone’s familiar with.

But sometimes we were getting annoyed by having to log in to our E-mail account on computers, we don't own just to download some attachments and it also refuses to send emails with more than 25MB of attachments, it’s hard to send large presentations, images or videos.However, there’s a workaround.  So, In the project we are trying to develop an application that requires minimum steps and also great for carrying and sharing files upto 100MB — providing people the right tools for their job.
